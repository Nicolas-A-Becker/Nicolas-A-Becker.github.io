        <h2>Beginnings</h2>
        <p>
            The chocolate chip cookie is, somewhat surprisingly, a relatively new invention.
            Created in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/sweet-morsels-a-history-of-the-chocolate-chip-cookie">1937</a>
             by Ruth Wakefield in her Toll House restaurant and inn, these cookies
            spread rather rapidly from their humble beginnings. By March 20, 1939 Nestle purchased the
            right to the cookie recipe for a mere dollar. This is truly where the popularity of
            this American cookie began.

        <h2>Spread</h2>
        <p>
            By the time World War II had started the chocolate chip cookie was modestly popular
            on the East Coast putting it in a great position to spread. Through advertisements
            and local efforts the chocolate chip cookie became one of the most popular desserts
            to be sent to the soldiers in the war effort. The return of these soldiers prompted
            the spread of these cookies throughout the United States. Now as it had spread so far
            cookie stores and businesses began opening up and growing rapidly which in turn
            cemented the chocolate chip cookie into the American palate.

        <h2>Cookies in the Making</h2>
        <p>
            There are many variations to the chocolate chip cookie now that it has had time to grow
            yet there is still a consistant base design to it. Traditionally the cookie is made up
            of a dough rich in butter, sugar, and vanilla with a sprinkling of chocolate chips added
            in. Variations to this design include the double chocolate chip cookie with a cocoa
            flavored dough and m&m cookies. There are of course almost limiteless variations of how
            to design a basic chocolate chip cookie but there will always be the original
